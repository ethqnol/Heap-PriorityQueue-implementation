# Heap-PriorityQueue-implementation

**Trigger warning: uses void functions; potentially dangerous for those who fanatically use functional programming.**

Priority queue for a simulated customer support center, where customers with the most money are the most valued.

Includes implementation for Heapify, buildHeap, extractMax, and insert, as well as a customer class that supports operator overloading and randomly generated customers. No fancy GUI ;(
